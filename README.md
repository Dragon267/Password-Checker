# Password-Checker
Search a directory for a specific key or password.

To setup up the project run:
    g++ -std=c++17 main.cpp -o main
    
Then to search a directory run:
    ./main
   
Then the program will ask you for the file directory and the key and then you will see where you have that key referenced.
